# confy-python

Official Confy API library client for python

__This library is generated by [alpaca](https://github.com/pksunkara/alpaca)__

## Installation

Make sure you have [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) installed

```bash
$ pip install confyio
```

#### Versions

Works with [ 2.6 / 2.7 / 3.2 / 3.3 ]

## Usage

There are two ways of loading the config.

 * You can either load it as a hash object with the same structure into a variable.
 * Or you can load it directly into `os.environ` with the key formed by concatenizing the path keys with underscores.

```python
import confy

# When the config is
# => { 'port': 6000, 'db': { 'pass': 'sun' } }

# Using URL
confy.Config.env("https://user:pass@api.confy.io/orgs/company/project/app/envs/production")

# or using options hash
confy.Config.env({
  'host': 'https://api.confy.io', 'user': 'user', 'pass': 'pass',
  'org': 'company', 'project': 'app', 'env': 'production'
});

# ['port']
os.environ['PORT'] # => 6000

# ['db']['pass']
os.environ['DB_PASS'] # => 'sun'

```

```python
# Retrieve the config using URL
config = confy.Config.load('https://user:pass@api.confy.io/orgs/company/project/app/envs/production')

# or using options hash
config = confy.Config.load({
  'host': 'https://api.confy.io', 'user': 'user', 'pass': 'pass',
  'org': 'company', 'project': 'app', 'env': 'production'
})

config['port'] # => 6000
config['db']['pass'] # => 'sun'

# Or you could instantiate a client to work with other api (as shown below)
```

### Build a client

__Using this api without authentication gives an error__

##### Basic authentication

```python
auth = { 'username': 'pksunkara', 'password': 'password' }

client = confy.Client(auth, client_options)
```

### Client Options

The following options are available while instantiating a client:

 * __base__: Base url for the api
 * __api_version__: Default version of the api (to be used in url)
 * __user_agent__: Default user-agent for all requests
 * __headers__: Default headers for all requests
 * __request_type__: Default format of the request body

### Response information

__All the callbacks provided to an api call will receive the response as shown below__

```python
response = client.klass('args').method('args', method_options)

response.code
# >>> 200

response.headers
# >>> {'x-server': 'apache'}
```

##### JSON response

When the response sent by server is __json__, it is decoded into a dict

```python
response.body
# >>> {'user': 'pksunkara'}
```

### Method Options

The following options are available while calling a method of an api:

 * __api_version__: Version of the api (to be used in url)
 * __headers__: Headers for the request
 * __query__: Query parameters for the url
 * __body__: Body of the request
 * __request_type__: Format of the request body

### Request body information

Set __request_type__ in options to modify the body accordingly

##### RAW request

When the value is set to __raw__, don't modify the body at all.

```python
body = 'username=pksunkara'
# >>> 'username=pksunkara'
```

##### JSON request

When the value is set to __json__, JSON encode the body.

```python
body = {'user': 'pksunkara'}
# >>> '{"user": "pksunkara"}'
```
